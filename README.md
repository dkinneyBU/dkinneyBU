- 👋 Hi, I’m Dave Kinney.
- 👀 I’m interested in Math, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Robotics, all forms of AI and Machine Learning, and reading hard science fiction. I am also an avid Pythonista, although these days I don't code as much as I'd like to.
- 🌱 I’m currently revisiting all the Math I learned in the 80s and 90s when I minored in the subject for my Bachelor degree,
- 💞️ I’m also currently an adjunct professor in the College of Science & Technology @ my alma mater, Bellevue University--go Bruins!
- 📫 You can reach me via email @ david.g.kinney.ms@gmail.com.
